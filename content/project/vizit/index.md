title: "Vizit: Visualization for Instructional Teams"
summary: "My team and I built a dashboard that is accessible to MOOC instructors directly in their edX course website. The dashboard will help instructors to discover patterns across the structures of their courses, with a special focus on course elements where student engagement is especially high or low."
